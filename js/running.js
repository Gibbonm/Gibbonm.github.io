	 document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML= "<h3>Less carb, more protein</h3><p> Carbohydrate (CHO) intake should be lower, due to the reduction in training volume. This may mean that only one meal (e.g. breakfast or lunch) needs to be carbohydrate based. This reduction in traininggives the flexibility to use a protein-rich breakfast, which can reduce hunger for the rest of the morning. Intakes of protein from meals and snacks should be high on these days to support ongoing muscle tissue growth and repair in the 24 hours following a heavy training day.</p><br><h3>Other nutrients</h3><br><p>Higher intakes of polyunsaturated fats (e.g. Omega-3) can help to reduce inflammation and aid the recovery process. Increased vegetable intakes with each meal (especially those high in antioxidants) help to reduce free radical damage from training and can subsequently reduce muscle soreness. Finally, this is the time to experiment with new recipes, flavours and spices.</p><h3>Training timing &ndash; when to eat</h3><p>For easier, low-intensity training sessions (e.g. 35 minute, easy run), many elite endurance athletes would undertake this session before breakfast so they are in a fasted state. This can be a worthwhile strategy as, by under fuelling the muscles, the stress on them increases so that they adapt and become more efficient. This strategy also primes the body to break down fat and use it as fuel for training, so it also can be an effective weight management strategy. It can take a while to get used to training fasted and shouldn&rsquo;t be used for high intensity training sessions.</p>";

Aim for a moderate protein intake as well, a serving of protein should be included with each meal for ongoing muscle growth and repair.</p><br><h3>Other nutrients</h3><br><p>Include polyunsaturated fats in your evening meal to promote the function of muscle cells.

Snacks can also be used to boost intake to support high training needs. A low-GI breakfast will provide sustained energy during the morning and for a longer run. Higher-GI carbohydrate snacks are useful pre-training. The increased carbohydrate intake means you should aim to limit fat, but a moderate protein intake should be maintained with each meal. Be sure to include an evening snack containing protein, as this is vital to help your body recover from a heavy training day and assist muscle growth overnight, as this is when the majority of adaptation will occur.</p><br><h3>Other nutrients</h3><p>Up your fluid intake to compensate for sweat losses during training and stick to tried and tested foods before setting out on a long run. Avoid foods that may cause gastrointestinal issues, such as spices, fatty or very high fibre foods.</p>";

	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="<h3>Why wear base layers?</h3><br><p>To run comfortably, both men and women should wear base layers which are suited for running and the shape of your body. Base layers for men (called a layer 0) are designed to be tight-fitting. They create a second skin effect, providing muscle support, guaranteeing constant warmth and making it easier to move. They are made of breathable materials which wick away perspiration and regulate your body temperature. If you're a woman, wear a sports bra. These garments have been specially tested and designed to maximise comfort during exercise, providing reinforced support, ease of movement and shock absorption. They are made of breathable, ventilated fabrics and seamless cups to prevent chafing. Sports bras made for running are also easy to slip on thanks to twilled, adjustable straps.</p><br><h3>Why wear a breathable t-shirt (layer 1)?</h3><p>When you run, the most important thing to do is keep your body temperature steady and your skin dry regardless of the intensity or length of your run or the weather conditions.To keep you warm and comfortable when you're running and in general, make sure to wear a garment, t-shirt or top made of breathable materials (your layer 1). This effectively wicks away perspiration while you are exercising, keeping your skin dry. <strong>Avoid cotton t-shirts at all costs. This type of fabric absorbs moisture and will chill your skin very quickly.</strong>Your Kalenji team and the thermal comfort experts at the OXYLANE research centre have designed specific running garments for you. These are made of a technical fabric composed of polyester fibre, elastane and polyamide, which keep your body warm and wick away perspiration. A Kalenji breathable t-shirt is a great, low-cost option to keep you comfortable during your run!</p><br><h3>Why wear insulating clothing (layer 2)?</h3><br><p>Since running is an outdoor sport, it is important to adapt your gear based on the weather conditions so that you stay warm and run in comfort. The most important thing is to maintain a good body temperature throughout your run. Breathable, insulating running clothing (called your layer 2) will keep the cold out and your body heat in. Running clothing provides optimal insulation and body temperature control by constantly circulating air when you are exercising.  Insulating garments are made of light, ventilated, warm fabrics. (For example: fleece jacket, running tights, temperature-regulating top, etc. )</p>"

	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="<h3>10K Novice Training Plan</h3><p>How much do you need to train to run your first 10K race ? If you possess a good level of fitness (because of participation in other sports) you probably could run a half dozen miles on very little training. The same if you have run a 5K or an 8K race before. You might be sore the week after a 10K race, but you still could finish. But if you’ve made the decision to run a 10K race you might as well do it right. Following is an 8 week training plan to help get you to the finish line of your first 10K. (For those of us used to old money, 10K is 6.2 miles). To participate in this 10K plan, you should have no major health problems, should be in reasonably good shape, and should have done at least some jogging or walking. If running 2.5 miles for your first workout on Tuesday of the first week seems too difficult, you might want to begin by walking, rather than running. Or, if you have more than 8-10 weeks before your 10K, switch to the 5K schedule to build an endurance base before continuing.</p><br><h4>Stretch & Strength</h4><p>Mondays are the days in which we advise you to do some stretching along with some strength training. This is actually a day of rest following your long run on Sundays. Do some easy stretching of your running muscles. This is good advice for any day, particularly after you finish your run, but spend a bit more time stretching on Mondays. Strength training could consist of push-ups, pull-ups, use of free weights or working out with various machines at a gym. Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of repetitions, rather than pumping very heavy iron. We also suggest that you do some strength training following your Thursday workouts, however you can schedule strength training on any two days convenient for you.</p><br><h4>Running Workouts</h4><p>Put one foot in front of the other and run. It sounds pretty simple, and it is. Don’t worry about how fast you run; just cover the distance or approximately the distance suggested. Ideally, you should be able to run at a pace that allows you to converse comfortably while you do so. This isn’t always easy for beginners, so don’t push too hard or too fast. Under this workout plan, you run three days of the week: Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays, Sundays being a longer run.</p><br><h4>Cross-Training</h4><p>On the schedule, this is identified simply as “cross.” What form of cross-training works best for runners preparing for a 10K race? It could be swimming, cycling, walking, other forms of aerobic training or even some combination that could include strength training if you choose to do it on Wednesdays and Saturdays instead of as indicated on the schedule. And feel free to throw in some jogging as well if you’re feeling good. What cross-training you select depends on your personal preference. But don’t make the mistake of cross-training too vigorously. Cross-training days should be considered easy days that allow you to recover from the running you do the rest of the week.</p><br><h4>Rest</h4><p>The most important day in any running program is rest. Rest days are as vital as training days. They give your muscles time to recover so you can run again. Actually, your muscles will build in strength as you rest. Without recovery days, you will not improve. In this plan, Friday is always scheduled as a day of rest to compliment the also easy workouts on Mondays.</p><br><h4>Long Runs</h4><p>The longest runs of the 8-week schedule are planned for Sundays, since you probably have more time to do them on the weekends. If Sunday isn’t a convenient day for your long runs, feel free to do them on Saturday or any other day of the week for that matter. What pace should you run? Go slow. There is no advantage to going fast during your long runs, even for experienced runners.</p><br><h4>Walking</h4><p>Walking is an excellent exercise that a lot of runners overlook in their training. In the training schedule below, we don’t specify walking workouts, but feel free to walk during your running workouts any time you feel tired or need a break. Nobody cares whether you run the full 10K, they’re more concerned that you finish. If this means walking every step in practice and in the race, do it.</p><br><p><a href='Training_Plans/10k-Novice-Training-Plan.pdf'><i>Click here to download the 10K Novice Schedule.</i></a></p>"

	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="<h3>Half Marathon Novice Training Plan</h3><br><p>Before starting to train for a half marathon, you need to possess a basic fitness level. And if you are over age 35, you probably should see your doctor for a physical examination. But assuming no major problems, most healthy people can train themselves to complete a 13.1-mile race. The following training plan assumes you have the ability to run 3 miles, three to four times a week. If that seems difficult, consider a shorter distance for your first race or take more time to develop an endurance base. The terms used in the training plan are somewhat obvious, but let us explain what they mean anyway.</p><br><h4>Pace</h4><p>Don’t worry about how fast you run your regular workouts. Run at a comfortable pace. If you’re training with a friend, the two of you should be able to hold a conversation. If you can’t do that, you’re running too fast. (For those wearing heart rate monitors, your target zone should be between 65 and 75 percent of your maximum pulse rate).</p><br><h4>Distance</h4><p>The training schedule dictates workouts at distances, from 3 to 10 miles. Don’t worry about running precisely those distances, but you should come close. Pick a course through the neighbourhood, or in some scenic area where you think you might enjoy running. Then measure the course either by car or bicycle. In deciding where to train, talk to other runners. They probably can point you to some accurately measured courses for your workouts. GPS watches seemingly make measuring courses easily, but trees and tall buildings sometimes can interfere with their accuracy.</p><br><h4>Rest</h4><p>Rest is as important a part of your training as the runs. You will be able to run the long runs on the weekend better and limit your risk of injury if you rest before, and rest after.</p><br><h4>Long Runs</h4><p>The key to getting ready to finish a half marathon is the long run, progressively increasing in distance each weekend. Over a period of 12 weeks, your longest run will increase from 3 to 10 miles. Don’t worry about making the final jump from 10 miles in practice to 13.1 miles in the race. Inspiration will carry you to the finish line, particularly if you taper the final week. The schedule below suggests doing your long runs on Saturdays, but you can do them Sundays, or any other convenient day, as long as you are consistent. </p><br><h4>Cross-Training</h4><p>On the schedule below, this is identified simply as “cross”. What form of cross-training works best? It could be swimming, cycling, walking or even some combination that could include strength training if you choose to do it on Wednesdays and Saturdays instead of as indicated on the schedule. And feel free to throw in some jogging as well if you’re feeling good. In fact, on Wednesdays we offer you the option to run or cross-train. What cross-training you select depends on your personal preference. But don’t make the mistake of cross-training too vigorously. Sports such as football or rugby that involve sideways motions or sudden stops and starts do not qualify as cross-training. In fact, you may increase your risk of injury if you double up on these sports, particularly as the mileage builds. Cross-training days should be considered easy days that allow you to recover from the running you do the rest of the week.</p><br><h4>Walking</h4><p>Walking is an excellent exercise that a lot of runners overlook in their training. We don’t specify walking breaks, but feel free to walk during your running workouts any time you feel tired or need to shift gears. When you go to the starting line in your twelfth week, nobody will care whether you run the full half marathon; they’re more concerned that you finish. If this means walking every step in practice and in the race, do it.</p><br><h4>Stretch & Strength</h4><p>Mondays are the days on which we advise you to spend extra time stretching and do some strength training too. This is actually a day of “rest” following your long run on the weekends, so don’t overdo it. It’s wise to stretch every day, particularly after you finish your run, but spend more time stretching on Mondays. Strength training could consist of push-ups, pull-ups, use of free weights or working out with various machines at a gym. Runners generally benefit if they combine light weights with a high number of repetitions, rather than pumping very heavy iron. We also suggest that you strength train following your Thursday workouts, however you can schedule strength training on any two convenient days. If you have not strength trained before beginning this training plan, you may want to postpone starting that activity until after your race.</p><br><h4>Take Time</h4><p>Does the 12-week progression from 3 to 13.1 miles seem too tough? Do you have more than a dozen weeks before your selected Half Marathon? Lengthen the schedule; take 18 or even 24 weeks to prepare. Repeat the week just completed before moving up to the next level. Don’t be afraid to insert “stepback” weeks, where you actually cut your distance every second or third week to gather forces for the next push upward.</p><br><h4>Racing</h4><p>It’s not obligatory, but you might want to run a 5K or 10K to see how you’re doing and also to experience a road race, if you have not run one before. You will be able to use your times to predict your finishing time in the half marathon, and what pace to run that race. We suggest a 5K race at the end of week 6 and a 10K race at the end of week 9. If you can’t find races at those distances on the weeks suggested, feel free to modify the schedule.</p><br><h4>Juggling </h4><p>Don’t be afraid to juggle the workouts from day to day and week to week. If you have an important business meeting on Thursday, do that workout on Wednesday instead. If your family is going to be on holiday one week when you will have more or less time to train, adjust the schedule accordingly. Be consistent with your training, and the overall details won’t matter.</p><br><p><a href='Training_Plans/Half-Marathon-Novice-Training-Plan.pdf'><i>Click here to download the Half-Marathon Novice Schedule.</i></a></p>"

	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="<h3>Marathon Novice Training Plan</h3><p>This is the novice training plan, the most popular of all the marathon training plans used by runners preparing to run their first marathons. Is this your first marathon? Have you only begun to run in the last month or two? This plan will get you to the starting line, and you can’t get to the finish line unless you get to the start. If you have been running for a year or more and have run a number of races from 5K to the half marathon, you might want to consider Intermediate, although many experienced runners also prefer Novice, because of the (relatively) gentle way it prepares you to run 26 miles 385 yards.</p><br><h4>long Runs</h4><p>The key to the program is the long run on weekends, which builds from 6 miles in Week 1 to 20 miles in the climactic Week 15. (After that, you taper to get ready for the marathon.) You can skip an occasional workout, or juggle the schedule depending on other commitments, but do not cheat on the long runs. Notice that although the weekly long runs get progressively longer, every third week is a “stepback” week, where we reduce mileage to allow you to gather strength for the next push upward. Rest is an important component of any training program.</p><br><h4>Run Slow</h4><p>Normally we recommend that runners do their long runs anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds or more per mile slower than their marathon pace. The problem with offering this advice to first-time novice runners, however, is that you probably don’t know what your marathon pace is, because you’ve never run a marathon before. Don’t worry. Simply do your long runs at a comfortable pace, one that allows you to converse with your training partners, at least during the beginning of the run. Toward the end, you may need to abandon conversation and concentrate on the act of putting one foot in front of the other to finish. However, if you find yourself finishing at a pace significantly slower than your pace from the first few miles, you probably need to start much slower, or include regular walking breaks. It’s better to run too slow during these long runs, than too fast. The important point is that you cover the prescribed distance; how fast you cover it doesn’t matter.</p><br><h4>Walking Breaks</h4><p> Some grizzled veterans offended by the Jeff Galloway walkers grumble that the marathon was meant to be run, not walked. Don’t listen to them. Walking is a perfectly acceptable strategy in trying to finish a marathon. It works during training runs too. While some coaches recommend walking 1 minute out of every 10, or walking 30 seconds then running 30 seconds before walking again, we suggest that runners walk when they come to an aid station. This serves a double function: 1) you can drink more easily while walking as opposed to running, and 2) since many other runners slow or walk through aid stations, you’ll be less likely to block those behind. It’s a good idea to follow this strategy in training as well. (If your long run course does not have water fountains, purchase a water belt to wear during your longest workouts and on the warmest days.) You will lose less time walking than you think. The famous runner, Bill Rodgers took four brief breaks (tying a shoe on one of them) while running 2:09 and winning the 1975 Boston Marathon. Walking gives your body a chance to rest, and you’ll be able to continue running more comfortably. It’s best to walk when you want to, not when your (fatigued) body forces you too.</p><br><h4>Cross-Training</h4><p> Sundays in the Novice training program are devoted to cross-training. What is cross-training? It is any other form of aerobic exercise that allows you to use slightly different muscles while resting (usually) after your long run. In the Novice 1 program, we run long on Saturdays and cross-train on Sundays, although it certainly is possible to reverse that order. The best cross-training exercises are swimming, cycling or even walking. What about sports such as tennis or basketball? Activities requiring sideways movements are not always a good choice. Particularly as the mileage builds up toward the end of the program, you raise your risk of injury if you choose to play a sport that requires sudden stopping and starting. One tip: You don’t have to cross-train the same each weekend. And you could even combine two or more exercises: walking and easy jogging or swimming and riding an exercise bike in a gym. Cross-training for an hour on Sunday will help you recover after your Saturday long runs.</p><br><h4>Strength Training</h4><p> A frequently asked question is: “Should I add strength training to my marathon program?” If you have to ask, you probably should not. We strongly endorse strength training for maximum fitness and long life, but if you never have pumped iron before, now is probably not the time to start. Wait until after you have that medal around your neck. For regular gym users, continue to work out, but you might want to cut back on the weights as the long run mileage moves into the double digits. Tuesdays and Thursdays work well for strength training after you finish your runs on those days.</p><br><h4>Midweek Training</h4><p> Training during the week should be done at a comparatively easy pace. As the weekend mileage builds, the weekday mileage also builds. Add up the numbers, and you’ll see that you run roughly the same mileage during the week as you do during long runs on the weekends. Midweek workouts on Wednesdays build from 3 to 10 miles. There are similar slight advances on Tuesdays and Thursdays although these are planned as “easy” days. Novice is built on the concept that you do more toward the end than at the start.</p><br><h4>Races</h4><p>Normally, we don’t prescribe races or at least too many races for first-time marathoners. Races can get in the way, particularly if you taper before a race and need extra recovery afterwards. But some racing is convenient, because it introduces newcomers to the racing experience: where to pin your number (on the front), how often to drink (neither too little nor too much), and what it feels like to run in a crowd of several thousand runners. We suggest you consider doing a half marathon in Week 8, a week when in the normal progression you might do 13 miles as your long run. No half marathon in your neighborhood that week? You can juggle the training schedule to match the local racing calendar. One advantage of doing a half is that afterwards, you can use one of the pace calculators available on the Internet (best is by Greg McMillan) to predict your marathon time.</p><br><h4>Rest</h4><p>Despite listing it at the end, rest is an important component of this or any training program. Scientists will tell you that it is during the rest period (the 24 to 72 hours between hard bouts of exercise) that the muscles actually regenerate and get stronger. Coaches also will tell you that you can’t run hard unless you are well rested. And it is hard running (such as the long runs) that allows you to improve. If you’re constantly fatigued, you will fail to reach your potential. This is why we include two days of rest each week for novice runners. If you need to take more rest days because of a cold or a late night at the office or a sick child do so. The secret to success in any training program is consistency, so as long as you are consistent with your training during the full 18 weeks of the program, you can afford and may benefit from extra rest.</p><br><p><a href='Training_Plans/Marathon-Novice-Training-Plan.pdf'><i>Click here to download the Marathon Novice Schedule.</i></a></p>"
