<h3>Less carb, more protein<h3><p> Carbohydrate (CHO) intake should be lower, due to the reduction in training volume. This may mean that only one meal (e.g. breakfast or lunch) needs to be carbohydrate based. This reduction in traininggives the flexibility to use a protein-rich breakfast, which can reduce hunger for the rest of the morning. Intakes of protein from meals and snacks should be high on these days to support ongoing muscle tissue growth and repair in the 24 hours following a heavy training day.</p><br><h3>Other nutrients</h3><br><p>Higher intakes of polyunsaturated fats (e.g. Omega-3) can help to reduce inflammation and aid the recovery process. Increased vegetable intakes with each meal (especially those high in antioxidants) help to reduce free radical damage from training and can subsequently reduce muscle soreness. Finally, this is the time to experiment with new recipes, flavours and spices.</p><h3>Training timing &ndash; when to eat</h3><p>For easier, low-intensity training sessions (e.g. 35 minute, easy run), many elite endurance athletes would undertake this session before breakfast so they are in a fasted state. This can be a worthwhile strategy as, by under fuelling the muscles, the stress on them increases so that they adapt and become more efficient. This strategy also primes the body to break down fat and use it as fuel for training, so it also can be an effective weight management strategy. It can take a while to get used to training fasted and shouldn&rsquo;t be used for high intensity training sessions.</p>
